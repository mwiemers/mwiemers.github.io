<p>The data cleaning series is going to teach you the most fundamental commands and techniques to prepare data in Stata for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The series is going to cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting string to numerical</li>
<li>Dealing with missings and duplicates</li>
<li>Applying variable and value labels</li>
<li>Reshaping between long and wide format</li>
<li>Merging multiple datasets</li>
</ul>
	  
	  <p>Data from online sources often comes in the wide format. The long format, however, is generally considered a cleaner way to represent repeated measurements 
		  and is also required for certain analysis in Stata. This session teaches you how to reshape data between the wide and long format. </p>
	  <p><b>By the end of this session, you will know how to:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>differentiate between long vs wide data formats</li>
<li>reshape data from wide to long</li>
<li>reshape data with one and multiple identifiers</li>
<li>reshape data from long to wide</li>
<li>reshape data with string suffixes</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#wide-and-long-data-formats" id="wide-and-long-data-formats">Wide and long data formats</a></h3>
<p>Before we explore the commands to reshape a dataset from one orientation to the other, let us first look at what the same data looks like in the wide and long orientation.</p>
<p>Below is a slightly modified version of the reshape2 dataset from the Stata server in wide format. The dataset has two variables, an id variable and three income variables for the years 1980 - 1982. This orientation is called wide, because the repeated measurement of the income variable over time, is spread across the columns from left to right, that is, there is a separate variable for each year. In this format each row represents a single observation.</p>
<pre><code>
     +----------------------------+
     | id   inc80   inc81   inc82 |
     |----------------------------|
  1. |  1    5000    5500    6000 |
  2. |  2    2000    2200    3300 |
  3. |  3    3000    2000    1000 |
  4. |  4    2400    2500    2400 |
     +----------------------------+

</code></pre>
<br>
<p>Below you can see what the same data would look like in long format. The different times of measurement of the income variable are no longer spread out across separate variables. There is a new variable <i>year</i>, that indicates the year of the measurement. Consequently, the dataset appears longer in shape. The key to understanding data in the long format is that repeated measurements of the same individual, or country in this case, are spread out across rows. As the <i>id</i> variable indicates there are now three rows per country - one row for each year.</p>
<pre><code>

     +------------------+
     | id   year    inc |
     |------------------|
  1. |  1     80   5000 |
  2. |  1     81   5500 |
  3. |  1     82   6000 |
  4. |  2     80   2000 |
  5. |  2     81   2200 |
     |------------------|
  6. |  2     82   3300 |

<h3><a href="#setting-up-our-practice-dataset" id="setting-up-our-practice-dataset">Setting up our practice dataset</a></h3>
<p>We are now going to set up a practice dataset based on the reshape2 dataset from the Stata server.</p>
<p>As you can see the dataset comes with an id column that does not provide a unique value for each observation. In order to identify each observation, you have to take into account the values from the <i>id</i> and <i>sex</i> variables.</p>
<pre><code>. webuse reshape2, clear

list

   +----------------------------------+
   | id   sex   inc80   inc81   inc82 |
   |----------------------------------|
1. |  1     0    5000    5500    6000 |
2. |  2     1    2000    2200    3300 |
3. |  3     0    3000    2000    1000 |
4. |  2     0    2400    2500    2400 |
   +----------------------------------+

</code></pre>
<br>
<p>We will cover reshaping a dataset where cases are defined by values from more than one variable later. To start with a simpler example, where a single variable defines each observation, we will first replace the last value in the id variable to 4. Now we only need the id variable in order to uniquely identify each observation, since each case/row has a unique value for the <i>id</i> variable.</p>
<pre><code>. replace id=4 in 4

<h3><a href="#reshaping-from-wide-to-long" id="reshaping-from-wide-to-long">Reshaping from wide to long</a></h3>
<p>The <b>reshape</b> command takes two arguments and has two options that have to be specified. Below is an example of how to reshape the income data to the long format.</p>
<pre><code>reshape long inc, i(id) j(year)
</code></pre>
<h4><a href="#1st-argument-longwide" id="1st-argument-longwide">1st argument: long/wide</a></h4>
<p>The first argument specifies whether the data should be reshaped to long or wide format. In this case, we want to reshape to <u>long</u>.</p>
<h4><a href="#2nd-argument-stub" id="2nd-argument-stub">2nd argument: stub</a></h4>
<p>The second argument specifies the stub for the measurement that is repeatedly measured over time. The income variables use the <i>inc</i> stub for each of the three variables that measure the income in 1980, 1981 and 1982.</p>
<h4><a href="#1st-option-i" id="1st-option-i">1st option: i()</a></h4>
<p>With the first option <u>i()</u>, you have to pass the variable that identifies the different observations in the dataset, which is the <i>id</i> variable.</p>
<h4><a href="#2nd-option-j" id="2nd-option-j">2nd option: j()</a></h4>
<p>The second option <u>j()</u> specifies the name for the new categorical variable that we want to create. Since the income variable is measured annually from 1980 - 1982, we call this variable <i>year</i>.</p>
<p>Let us run the reshape command and see the output it produces.</p>
<p>The <b>reshape</b> command generates a table that summarizes how the dataset has been restructured. The first row shows that the data have been reshaped from wide to long format. The table also lists how the reshape has increased the number of observations from 4 to 12 and has reduced the number of variables from 5 to 4. The new j variable <i>years</i> has been created with 3 values (80, 81, 82) and the values from the three income variables <i>inc80</i>, <i>inc81</i> and <i>inc82</i> have been combined in a single variable <i>inc</i>.</p>
<pre><code>. reshape long inc, i(id) j(year)
(note: j = 80 81 82)

<br>
<p>If we now list the dataset, we see the changes in the actual dataset. A new categorical variable <i>year</i> has been created. The income from each year is now represented across three rows per observation. The values in the <i>sex</i> column are being repeated for the three rows belonging to each respondent.</p>

<p>The original reshape2 dataset requires values from the <i>id</i> and <i>sex</i> variable in order to identify the observations in the dataset. The value 2 repeats in the 4th row of <i>id</i> variable. However, since the <i>sex</i> variable has different values for the second and fourth row, we can uniquely identify each observation by looking at both the values from the <i>id</i> and <i>sex</i> variables.</p>
